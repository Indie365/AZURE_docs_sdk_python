summary: 'This represents the blob storage account location where exports of costs
  will be delivered. There are two ways to configure the destination. The approach
  recommended for most customers is to specify the resourceId of the storage account.
  This requires a one-time registration of the account''s subscription with the Microsoft.CostManagementExports
  resource provider in order to give Cost Management services access to the storage.
  When creating an export in the Azure portal this registration is performed automatically
  but API users may need to register the subscription explicitly (for more information
  see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services)
  ). Another way to configure the destination is available ONLY to Partners with a
  Microsoft Partner Agreement plan who are global admins of their billing account.
  These Partners, instead of specifying the resourceId of a storage account, can specify
  the storage account name along with a SAS token for the account. This allows exports
  of costs to a storage account in any tenant. The SAS token should be created for
  the blob service with Service/Container/Object resource types and with Read/Write/Delete/List/Add/Create
  permissions (for more information see [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/export-cost-data-storage-account-sas-key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/export-cost-data-storage-account-sas-key)
